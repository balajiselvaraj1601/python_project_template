# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! 🎉
Contributions of all kinds—bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements, and refactors—are welcome and appreciated.

This guide describes the expected workflow and standards to help keep contributions consistent and easy to review.

## Before You Start

Before making any changes, please:

- Read the project **README.md** for setup instructions and background context
- Search existing **issues** and **pull requests** to avoid duplicating work
- For larger or breaking changes, consider opening an issue first to discuss the approach

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Create a new branch with a descriptive name:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/short-description
```

### 3. Set Up the Development Environment

Follow the setup instructions in the repository `README.md`.

## Testing

All changes must be tested.

- Run the full test suite locally:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```

- Add or update tests for:
  - New features
  - Bug fixes
  - Any change that affects behavior

Pull requests with failing or missing tests will not be merged.

## Code Style and Quality

This project enforces automated formatting and linting.

Before submitting your changes, run:

```bash
uv run ruff
uv run black
```

Ensure that:

- Code is properly formatted

## Making Changes

When working on your contribution:

- Keep commits **small and focused**
- Follow existing patterns and project structure
- Avoid unrelated refactors or formatting-only changes
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a pull request against the main repository
3. In the pull request description:
   - Clearly explain what the change does
   - Reference related issues (for example, `Closes #123`)
   - Call out any breaking changes or follow-up work

Maintainers may request changes or clarifications before merging.
