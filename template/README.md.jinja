## Overview

**{{ project_name }}** is a modern Python library focused on **correctness,
maintainability, and developer experience**. It is designed as a reusable
library rather than an application, with an emphasis on clear APIs, strong
typing, and predictable behavior.

The project is well-suited for data science and analytical workflows while
remaining lightweight and composable.

---

## Features

- 🔬 **Rigorous Testing**
  Comprehensive unit tests to ensure correctness and safe refactoring.

- 🧠 **Copilot-Optimized**
  Project structure, naming, and typing are designed for effective AI-assisted
  development.

- ⚡ **Modern Tooling**
  Uses `uv`, `ruff`, and `basedpyright` for fast, reliable workflows.

- 📊 **Data Science Ready**
  {% if include_numpy %}NumPy{% endif %}{% if include_numpy and include_pandas_support %}, {% endif %}{% if include_pandas_support %}pandas{% endif %} integration where applicable.

- 🎯 **Type Safe**
  Strict typing throughout, including a `py.typed` marker for downstream users.

- 📦 **Well Packaged**
  Follows modern Python packaging and project layout standards.

## Installation

Install the package using either `pip` or `uv`.

```bash
# Using pip
pip install {{ package_name }}

# Using uv
uv add {{ package_name }}
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from {{ package_name }} import example_function

result = example_function(42)
print(result)
```

{% if include_numpy %}
```python
import numpy as np
from {{ package_name }}.core import example_array_function

arr = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
result = example_array_function(arr)
print(result)
```
{% endif %}

## Development Setup

This project uses **uv** for dependency management and **just** as a task runner.

### Prerequisites

- Python {{ python_min_version }}+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) (optional but recommended)

---

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/{{ github_username }}/{{ project_slug }}.git
cd {{ project_slug }}

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

---

## Development Workflow

Using `just`:

```bash
# Format code
just fmt

# Run linter
just lint

# Run type checker
just typecheck

# Run tests
just test

# Run all CI checks locally
just ci

# Run tests with coverage
just coverage
```

Without `just`:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run basedpyright
uv run pytest
```

## Design Philosophy

This library is built around a few key principles:

- **Library-First**
  Designed as a reusable library, not an application or service.

- **Type Safety**
  Strict typing is enforced at every level.

- **Testability**
  Code is structured to be easy to test and reason about.

- **AI-Friendly**
  Naming, structure, and documentation support AI-assisted development.

- **Modern Python**
  Targets Python {{ python_min_version }}+ and modern language features.

- **Deterministic Builds**
  Dependency locking via `uv` ensures reproducible environments.
